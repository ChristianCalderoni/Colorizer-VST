Colorizer is a MIDI-controlled polyphonic resonator. The algorithm adjusts the delay time of up to eight independent fractional delay lines with feedback to generate pitch-specific resonances in the input signal, based on the MIDI notes played by the user.

You can find the Windows compatible '.vst3' file here: [Colorizer Windows](Builds/Windows/x64).

Alternatively, you can download the compiled VST3 and Audio Unit (AU) plugin versions from the following link: [Colorizer plugin](https://audioplugins.lim.di.unimi.it/index.php?p=2) (search for "Colorizer").

## Parameters

- ADSR: controls the amplitude envelope applied to the wet signal.
- Feedback: adjusts the intensity and duration of the resonances by setting the feedback level of the delay lines.
- Negative: inverts the sign of the feedback multiplication factor, emphasizing odd harmonics over even ones.
- Wet Amount: sets the level of the wet signal.
- Damping: sets the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter in the feedback path, affecting how quickly high frequencies decay.
- Tune: allows fine-tuning of the overall pitch of the resonated signal.
